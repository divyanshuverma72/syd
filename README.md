# syd
syd( secure your data) is a python script, that captures the images, when someone insert any removable devices to your system. It captures the images every 20 second till the removable device is connected. As of now it is working on Windows 10.
# Working
Run syd.py on command prompt of your Windows 10 with command 'python syd.py'. Before that make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system.
From line no. 3 you can change the time interval. In my case it is 20 sec.
In line no. 12, you can change the location of your file where you want to save the images.
Now you are good to go...have fun.
